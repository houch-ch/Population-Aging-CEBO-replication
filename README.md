Impact Characteristics of Population Aging on Carbon Emissions from Building Operations in Typical Countries
Replication Data and Code Repository

This repository provides the cleaned panel dataset and Stata code used to reproduce the main empirical results in “Impact Characteristics of Population Aging on Carbon Emissions from Building Operations in Typical Countries”.

Contents

Panel Data and Documentation.xlsx

Sheet “panel data” contains the cleaned country-year panel (81 countries, 1970–2023).

Sheet “Documentation” provides variable definitions and data processing notes.

Sheets “Replacement of CEBO” and “Replacement of Aging” contain data used for robustness checks.

Code.do

Stata do-file for the main analyses (annotated by table).

Data sources
CEBO is derived from EDGAR. All other variables are obtained from the World Bank. The raw data are publicly available from these sources. The repository provides the cleaned analysis dataset for replication.

Software
Stata 17.

How to run

Download the Excel file and Code.do.

Open Stata, set the working directory to the repository folder, and run Code.do.

The do-file reproduces the main empirical results reported in the manuscript and supplementary materials.
